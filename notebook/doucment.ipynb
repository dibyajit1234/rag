INTRODUCTION \\n1.1 Problem statement \\nThough widely deployed, most applications are plagued by serious problems with user data \\nprivacy, inconsistent performance across devices, and limited customization for emerging \\ncreators and communities. Besides, complicated backend infrastructure and deployment barriers \\nmake it hard for small developers and startups to build a scalable, secure, and real-time social \\nplatform. In view of the above-mentioned limitations, this project will propose a cross-platform \\nsocial network application using Flutter and Dart, with Firebase Authentication providing secure \\naccess control and Firebase, Cloudinary, NodeJS and ExpressJS for managing users, posts, reels, \\nand messages efficiently. By deploying the system on Render, seamless cloud hosting and \\nscalability are assured. It shall be a modern, user-friendly, and high-performance social \\nnetworking platform that has placed an emphasis on security, real-time interaction, and \\naccessibility for a wide range of users. \\n1.2 Objectives of the Project \\nThe chief objective is to create a feature-rich, cross-platform social media application that will \\nenable users to connect, share, and communicate smoothly through posts, reels, and real-time \\nmessaging. It shall be developed using Flutter and Dart for the front end, ensuring a smooth and \\nresponsive feel on user devices. Firebase Authentication is integrated into the system to ensure \\nthat user registration and login occur securely and reliably, while Cloudinary and Firebase will \\nbe used as the database at the backend to manage user profiles, media, and interaction efficiently. \\nThe app will implement scalable cloud deployment using Render to make sure that it is highly \\navailable and high-performance.

LITERATURE REVIEW \\n2.1 Existing Works \\nIn today’s time, real time chat applications have become a most common medium for \\ncommunication, enabling instant messaging and social interaction in various domains like \\nbusiness, education, social networking, etc. One of the most important factor that users look for, \\nin such chat applications, is their privacy. This research paper focuses on privacy-preserving real \\ntime chat applications, which aims to protect the confidentiality and integrity of messages, at the \\nsame time maintaining real-time communication capabilities. The advantages and limitations of \\neach technique are discussed, along with their applicability in different scenarios. Moreover, the \\npaper also addresses the challenges and considerations in designing and implementing privacy-\\npreserving real time chat applications. This chat application is going to be a multi-user chat \\napplication and it will not be storing the messages data. The key technologies used in building \\nthis chat application are Node JS, Express JS, React JS and Firebase. Keywords—Real time chat \\napplication, Multi-user chat application, Privacy-preserving chat, Node.js, React.js, Socket.io \\nchat application, Express.js. [1] \\nThe chat application is something that lets people get in touch with each other directly. People \\ncan interact using this online application. People can interact using this online application even \\nwhen they are far apart, effectively. This web-based application is supposed to be real-time and \\nmulti-platform to be utilized by many people. Chatterbox is a real-time chat application \\ndeveloped using MERN stack development, thus it is easily extendable and developed with \\nrecent technologies. Also, it has features like voice calls, video calls, screen sharing, chatting, \\nand much more for users in one application. The application is particularly more secure and \\ncomes with the option of screen sharing, which other applications mostly do not have, making it \\nhandy and easily reliable as well. Also, due to extensible code and with further system demands \\nto run higher ends of the project, multiple features can be added to the application and the \\napplication can be extended..

This paper aims to design and implement WebRTC-6 chat, \\nvideo communication, and recording between peers (browser-to-browser) using Chrome and \\nFirefox in a real application based on mesh topology. Therefore, a signalling channel between \\nthe two peers for chatting and video conferencing has been produced and implemented by using \\nthe following: Socket.io mechanism, Node.JS platform, and Express.JS. Also Axios (HTTP \\nJSON), and JavaScript is the major programming language used. The results of this work have \\nascertained that the signalling channel has been built up and implemented.

[3] \\n \\nNew technologies have changed the way people communicate with each other. Messaging \\napplications are among the most usable means of communication in the modern digital world. To \\nbe able to do so, a number of chat applications have been developed. In this paper, we present a \\nchat application using the MERN stack, which is one of the most popular stacks that can be used \\nin web application development. The presented solution allows users to create an account, join \\nchat rooms, and send messages to all the users in that room. By utilizing WebSockets along with \\nAngular's two-way binding, the users are able to see any messages as soon as they are sent. In \\naddition, this application provides user authentication and authorization, hence offering secure \\naccess to chat rooms. We wish to prove the viability and efficiency of the application of the \\nMern stack in building real-time chat applications. [4] \\n \\n2.2 Research Gaps Identified \\nBy analyzing the related work, it can be understood that, although several real-time chat and \\nsocial networking applications have been built using MERN stack, WebRTC, and Socket.io \\ntechnologies, many of them are basically focused on either text or media communication and do \\nnot provide an overall sense of community-driven social network sites. Most of the existing \\nsystems are focused on providing only messaging and calling facilities without integrating \\ndiversified social features like creating posts, reels, content feeds, and interactive engagement on \\na single platform. Moreover, several existing applications face problems regarding scalability \\nissues, limited cross-platform optimization, and incomplete security implementation, especially \\nwith respect to data privacy, user authentication, and protection against unauthorized access.

CONCLUSION & FUTURESCOPE \\n \\n6.1 Conclusion \\nIn essence, this social media application is an achievement in modern networking, information \\nsharing, and community engagement. The integration of key development technologies like \\nFlutter, Firebase, Cloudinary and Render ensures the delivery of a robust, scalable, and user-\\nfriendly platform that upgrades online social interaction and connectivity. \\nThe performance of the application in various conditions, from development to evaluation, was \\nquite good: reliable and responsive. User testing confirmed that the subjects were very satisfied \\nwith the design of the interface, the ease of navigation, and the set of features including real-time \\nmessaging, posting of multimedia, and dynamic content feeds. Firebase Authentication ensured a \\nstrong mechanism for user verification, while Firebase provided efficient, consistent data \\nmanagement across all social features. \\nThis social media platform is positioned to herald the next wave of innovation as digital \\ninteraction continues to advance. It has a strong basis for future development to feature \\ncommunity engagement and creative expression on a larger, global scale. The performance-\\ndriven, user-friendly, and innovative project serves as an epitome of what full-stack mobile \\ndevelopment offers for the next generation of social media ecosystems. \\nFurthermore, the application puts great emphasis on security, scalability, and user experience to \\neasily fit into evolving user demands and changes in technology. Its modular architecture will \\nallow for easy integration of future features that include AI-driven content recommendations, \\nlive streaming, advanced analytics, and monetization tools. \\n6.2 Limitations and Future Scope  \\nAlthough SociGo effectively implements the core features of any modern social media platform, \\nthere are still some limitations to the current version. The backend of the application is functional \\nbut might not handle very high traffic or large-scale user interactions efficiently due to limited \\nscaling mechanisms. Advanced security measures, such as  encryption of chats also multi-factor \\nauthentication, have yet to be implemented, which would further enhance data protection.
